        <h1 class="hed">Hire Me Project<br> Prajwol Thapa, 10th grade</h1>
        <h6>(tldr at bottom)</h6>

        <p>My name is Prajwol Thapa, I am currently in 10th grade. I like playing games, watching anime, and also enjoy trading stocks and coding from time to time. I can't live without my internet, anime, and games. My favorite shows are the Monogatari Series and Kekkai Sensen, and my favorite game right now is Genshin Impact(Doom,Horizon, and God of War are up there too). I joined code nation to get better at coding.<br><a href="https://genshin.mihoyo.com/en/home" target="_blank"><img src="https://media.playstation.com/is/image/SCEA/genshin-impact-normalhero-01-ps4-17aug20-en-us?$native_nt$"></a></p>

        <p>I picked up trading during the market crash in March, everything was such a good deal at that time that you could have bought anything and made lots of money. It's been around seven months since, and I can finally say I am getting used to this. Wake up, check the market, look at top runners, charts, and scanners. I usually wait till market-open at 9:30 to trade. I buy whatever I think will run(go up in value) after market-open, usually, within 5 mins before market open and set my stop loss and profit order and watch what happens. In premarket and after-hours, automatic sell orders don't work, so it's a bit too risky to trade.<br><a href="https://app.webull.com/trade?source=google-search-pc-pp-gw" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.educba.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Stock-Market-Trading.jpg"></a></p>
        
        <p>In five years(and more), I see my life pretty much the same as now. I think my parents plan on moving out and close to family once I am fully independent, so other than me living by myself and having to take care of some bills, nothing else should be different. I started doing everything I want to be doing in the future. By the time I have to take care of myself and have no support, I will be good enough at those things(like trading or programming) that I don't have to worry about the risks of losing money by trading or not being able to get a job if that does occur. <br><img src="https://www.tinacreates.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/5-years-time.jpg"></p>
